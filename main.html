        <li><strong>Foundation of the Web:</strong> Every webpage you visit is built using HTML, making it the foundation of the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy to Learn:</strong> HTML is beginner-friendly, making it accessible to anyone starting their web development journey.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</strong> HTML works seamlessly across all modern web browsers.</li>
        <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> HTML integrates with CSS and JavaScript to create dynamic and visually appealing websites.</li>

    <h2>Basic Structure of an HTML Document</h2>
    <p>An HTML document follows a standardized structure that includes:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            <strong>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</strong>
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        - The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration specifies the HTML version being used.<br>
        - The &lt;html&gt; element is the root of the document.<br>
        - The &lt;head&gt; section contains metadata, including the title and linked stylesheets.<br>
        - The &lt;body&gt; section contains the visible content of the webpage.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Elements of HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML includes a wide variety of elements to create structured content. Some of the most commonly used ones are:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Headings</h3>
    <p>HTML provides six levels of headings, from &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;, to define the hierarchy of content.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
        <strong>
&lt;h1&gt;Main Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subheading&lt;/h2&gt;
</strong>
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>2. Paragraphs</h3>
    <p>Paragraphs are defined using the &lt;p&gt; tag:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
        <strong>
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
</strong>
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>3. Links</h3>
    <p>Links are created using the &lt;a&gt; tag with the <code>href</code> attribute:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
        <strong>
&lt;a href="https://example.com"&gt;Visit Example&lt;/a&gt;
</strong>
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>4. Images</h3>
    <p>Images are added using the &lt;img&gt; tag with <code>src</code> and <code>alt</code> attributes:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
        <strong>
&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" /&gt;
</strong>
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>5. Lists</h3>
    <p>HTML supports two types of lists:
    </p>

        <li><strong>Ordered List:</strong> Numbered list items using the &lt;ol&gt; tag.</li>
        <li><strong>Unordered List:</strong> Bulleted list items using the &lt;ul&gt; tag.</li>
    
    <pre>
        <code>
        <strong>
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</strong>
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>6. Tables</h3>
    <p>Tables are structured using &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, and &lt;th&gt; tags:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
        <strong>
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Header 1&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Header 2&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Data 1&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Data 2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</strong>
        </code>
    </pre>
